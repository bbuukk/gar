<h2>Motivation 😤</h2>
As a bachelor graduate from the <a href="https://www.ukma.edu.ua/eng/">National University of "Kyiv-Mohyla Academy"</a> in Kyiv, Ukraine, I had the opportunity to channel passion for creating software into my graduate work. This project is a testament to my academic journey and the skills I've acquired along the way.
<br><br>
For those interested in delving deeper into the details of this project, I invite you to explore the text part of my work. It is written in Ukrainian. You can access it via the following <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10jEfeoX3Pf5aoHtpTMkvRQZyCPpZi1aN/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115259788176037092559&rtpof=true&sd=true">document link.</a>

    What problem does it solve?

        It just gives clients real comfortability in shopping products they need.
        They can search by input or by category, see detailed description of the product, price, etc.
        Customers can order everything they need in the blick of an eye.

    What did you learn?

        I learned a lot making this website. When i just started i didn't even know html properly.
        Now I have significant knowledge in MERN stack, using no-sql mongoDb, using node.js and express.js creating back-end server and using react for front-end. 
        I also have practiced a lot with bootstrap, sass and mui library.
